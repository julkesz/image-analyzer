# Photo sharing platform

## Description
Overall aim of the project is to implement a microservice based platform for sharing photos among photography enthusiasts. Any (anonymous) user is able to scroll through the photos, but to share them, users have to create an account. After that they are able to upload and share their photos. Once uploaded, the photos are processed to assign tags for efficient searching and filtering.

## System architecture
The system is hosted using Google Cloud Provider. These cloud computing services allow us to use serverless architecture, which is similar to Kubernetes cluster and pods solution, but manages resources automatically. Deployment is performed using docker hub links to images, which can be configured and are downloaded directly. App consists of 5 distinct microservices, working in virtual network.

### Microservices
#### WebApp
This microservice is responsible for managing the user's interactions. It provides a main view and access to functions, such as uploading photos. Firstly, it authorizes users using Oauth2 and manages users’ requests about photos, passes images’ contents to Google Cloud Storage and image information to Data Service.

#### PostgreSQL
Relational database which stores information about photos and basic user information (id, email, role). PostreSQL communicates with the whole application only through Data Service.

#### Data Service
Main functionality of this microservice is to communicate with the PostgreSQL database. It serves requests sent by WebApp regarding photos and users. When a new photo is being uploaded, Data Service stores its information (url, name, description) in the database and forwards it to Kafka so that it can later receive image tags and store them in the database.

#### Kafka
Service for managing asynchronous communication based on Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is widely used in distributed systems for handling real-time data streams. It provides a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and durable messaging system that allows for the reliable and efficient transfer of data between different components or systems within a distributed architecture. In our application Kafka receives image information (url, name, description) and sends them to Image Analyzer so that it can process it. Later, it sends back to Data Service results of the image processing.

#### Image Analyzer
Microservice responsible for providing images’ tags. It uses Google Cloud Vision API, which provides a range of image analysis capabilities, including the ability to tag or label pictures with relevant information. It allows developers to integrate powerful image analysis capabilities into their applications. The Vision API utilizes machine learning models to understand and extract information from images, enabling developers to build applications with visual recognition and understanding capabilities. It's important to note that the accuracy and quality of the tags generated by the Vision API depend on factors such as the complexity of the image and the clarity of the content. Additionally, the Vision API offers other advanced features beyond tagging, such as face detection, text recognition, and image content moderation. In our application Google Cloud Vision API is used to extract tags from the photos.
